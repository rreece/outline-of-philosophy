### Note: This is under construction

This site is my working draft of notes from philosophy papers I read.
I share it here for collaborators and perhaps general interest (when I get it better organized).

### Note: Scope disclaimer

While the scope of this project is ambitiously large,
clearly it cannot pretend to represent *all* of philosophy by any stretch.
This is a meandering of one person through his own thoughts on philosophy,
a meandering that is primarily western and focused on empiricism,
although not entirely either.


### Note: But there's a lot here that isn't even philosophy?

When I'm trying to understand something, I don't see a sharp line between
knowing my way around and getting into the details.

Wilfrid Sellars:

>   The aim of philosophy, abstractly formulated, is to understand how
>   things in the broadest possible sense of the term hang together in the
>   broadest possible sense of the term. Under 'things in the broadest
>   possible sense' I include such radically different items as not only
>   'cabbages and kings', but numbers and duties, possibilities and finger
>   snaps, aesthetic experience and death. To achieve success in philosophy
>   would be, to use a contemporary turn of phrase, to 'know one's way
>   around' with respect to all these things... [^Sellars1963p1a]
